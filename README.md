# Markdown-ImageLocalize
[‰∏≠ÊñáREADME](./README_ZH.md) 

This code is adapted from [Img_link_to_local_markdown](https://github.com/xZaR3y4p/Img_link_to_local_markdown)

This is a python script that scans all the markdown files of a folder looking for images links, 
and substitutes the urls of the markdown files for local file names, 
and download the images.

# Why?üõ†Ô∏è
Offline markdown files are a reliable way to store and organize information.
When copying from the web the text is copied directly, but images are copied as links.
If the link expires in the future, or you are offline, you lose the information.
It would be great to have every picture added as a link downloaded to local storage.

# Features‚≠ê
+ Support both `<img>` and `![]()` labels.

+ Add more options to custom the behaviors(e.g. whether to modify source markdown files).

+ Download images in ***Async*** mode, which performs well to decrease exec time:

    |  vanilla code   | async code  |
    |  ----  | ----  |
    | 28.420s  | 5.236s |
    
+ Support ***loop traversal*** of markdown files.

+ Save the link between the images and the urls, which enables user and this program to ***re-download*** failed images.


# UsageüöÄ

1. Install Python on your computer.
2. Clone this Repo `git clone https://github.com/YellowAndGreen/Md-ImgLocalize.git`.
3. Install aiohttp `pip install -r requirements.txt` .
4. Change to the Repo's directory
5. Run `python main.py --md_path=[md_path]` in command line:
    + specify `md_path` as your markdown files directory
    + use `--log` to save the complete log file, **NOTE**: using --log leads to no output on the screen
    + use `--modify_source` to modify source markdown files directly, this option create image folders under markdown file directory
    + use `--coroutine_num` to specify the number of coroutines, set to 1 if async feature is not needed.
